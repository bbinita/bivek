        <p className="description">
          I am a researcher specializing in remote sensing, precision
          agriculture, and plant stress detection, with a strong background in
          multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, GIS, and statistical
          modeling. My academic journey has spanned from agricultural sciences
          to advanced geospatial analytics, where I have developed expertise in
          integrating UAV-based sensing, image processing, and data science to
          address agricultural and environmental challenges. Through my Ph.D.
          research, I have led multi-year experiments to detect biotic and
          abiotic stress in crops, applying advanced statistical models and
          machine learning techniques to spectral data. My work bridges plant
          science, remote sensing, and digital agriculture, with applications
          extending to natural resource management, pest monitoring, and
          sustainable crop production. I am well equiped with skills in spectral
          image processing, spatial analysis, UAV operation and statistical
          programming enabling me to translate complex datasets into actionable
          insights. My portfolio highlights this interdisciplinary expertise,
          showcasing selected projects, publications, and technical outputs that
          reflect my commitment to sustainable agriculture and innovative
          geospatial solutions.
